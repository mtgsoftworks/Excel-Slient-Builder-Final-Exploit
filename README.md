# Excel-Slient-Builder-Final-Exploit

This Python script is designed to create and inject a malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro into an Excel file. The goal is to silently convert a PE (Portable Executable) file, such as an .exe, into a VBA macro that can be embedded in an Excel document. This document can then be used to execute the PE file when the Excel file is opened, leveraging the macro functionality within Microsoft Office Excel.

## Features
## - PE to VBA Conversion: Converts a PE file (e.g., .exe) into a VBA macro.
## - Macro Injection: Injects the VBA macro into an Excel file.
## - Excel File Conversion: Supports conversion between different Excel file formats (e.g., .xls to .xlsm).
## - Excel Settings Management: Automatically enables and disables Excel VBOM (Visual Basic for Applications Object Model) access as needed.
## - Clean-up: Removes temporary files and restores Excel settings after execution.

## How It Works

## 1-) Initial Setup:

The script begins by importing necessary libraries for file management, Windows registry manipulation, and Excel automation using COM (Component Object Model).
It checks if the system is running on Windows, as the script is designed exclusively for Windows environments.
## 2-) Base64 Library Extraction:

A Base64 encoded string (lib_bs64) is decoded, saved as a zip file (lib.zip), and extracted. This step is intended to unpack required dependencies.
## 3-) Excel File Conversion:

The excel_convert() function handles converting Excel files from one format to another (e.g., .xls to .xlsm).
## 4-) VBOM Enabling/Disabling:

The script includes functions to enable (enableVbomExcel()) and disable (disableVbomExcel()) access to the VBA Object Model via the Windows registry, allowing the script to programmatically add macros.
## 5-) VBA Macro Injection:

The excelMacro() function injects the VBA macro into the specified Excel file, reading the macro from the RunPE.vba file.
## 6-) PE to VBA Conversion:

The pe_to_vba() function converts a PE file into a VBA macro string, encoding the binary data into a format that VBA can process.
## 7-) Template Application:

The apply_template() function inserts the converted PE data into a VBA template, which includes the necessary code to execute the PE file when the Excel file is opened.
## 9-) Execution:
The main() function ties everything together, prompting the user for input files, performing conversions and injections, and cleaning up temporary files.

# Usage
Run the script on a Windows machine with the necessary Python environment.
Provide the required input files when prompted (e.g., an .exe file and an Excel file).
The script will generate a new Excel file with the embedded macro, designed to execute the PE file when the document is opened.
